001 - Creating a Chapter

Before you are able to make questions for quizzes you must generate the chapter files which will store the questions. All questions are sorted by chapters, with each chapter having a numerical value (1, 2, 3, etc.) in order to mirror the chapters of a text book. When a quiz is generated it will pull random questions from a specified chapter.

To create a chapter file you must run "Chapter Generator.py". You will then be asked for the number of the chapter (1, 2, 3, etc.). Once you input the chapter number the program will generate the chapter file. Note that chapter files are all stored in the "Questions" folder, as for example "Chapter 1.txt". Once the chapter file is generated you can then move on to creating the questions.

002 - Creating Questions

After you have created a chapter file you can now create question for that chapter. Be sure that you generate the chapter file before attempting to add questions to it otherwise it may not work correctly.

To add questions to a chapter you must run "Question Generator.py". You will first be asked for your name. Your name will be stored with each question that you make in order to identify you as the one who made the question. You will then be asked which chapter you want to make questions for, be sure to enter the correct number of the chapter (1, 2, 3, etc.).

You will then be asked for the question. Be sure to end the question with a question mark and not a period. You will then be asked for the four multiple choice answers for the question, note that you are asked them one at a time. You do not need to add a prefix to the answers like "a)" or "b." as the program will automatically add those in. After you enter all four multiple answers you must then enter the number of the correct answer (1, 2, 3, or 4).

The program will then output the question in the format it will be displayed durring the quiz with the correct answer as well. At this point you should check it for spelling, grammar, or other mistakes. You will then be asked if the question is correct, and if it is correct then input a lower case "y". If the question is not correct then input "n", and you will then be asked to re-input the question info.

Once you have correctly entered the question you will be asked if you would like to make another question for that same chapter. If you would like to enter another question for the same chapter then input "y", and you will then be able to input another question. You can enter as many questions in a row as you want, but they will only be saved after you select that you do not want to enter any more questions to the selected chapter. When you are done entering questions for the selected chapter input "n", and then the question(s) you have entered will be saved to the selected chapter file.

In order to add more questions to a chapter different than the chapter specified when the program was run you must finish running the program, and then re-run the program but specifiy the new chapter that you want to add questions to.
=====================
003 - Creating a Quiz

Once you have added some questions to a chapter you can now generate quizzes for that chapter. Currently quizzes can only be done by using a computer to input your answers, there is currently no function to output quizzes into a print-able format.

To do a randomly generated quiz on a topic you must run "Quiz Generator.py". You will then be asked which chapter you would like to take a quiz on. You must then input the number of the chapter that you want to answer questions from (1, 2, 3, etc.). You will then be told how many questions are in the specified chapter. You then need to input how many questions from the chapter you want to answer in the quiz (1, 2, 3, etc.). Note that you cannot enter a number higher than the number of questions avalible in the specified chapter, as that would not be a possible quiz to make.

The program will then randomly grab a question from the chapter and let you try to answer it. You must enter the number of the correct answer (1, 2, 3, or 4). If you answer the question correctly then the program will let you know that you answered the question correctly. If you answer the question incorrectly then the question will let you know that the answer you entered was not correct and it will let you know what the correct answer was.

Note that the questions are outputed in the following format:

2) What is 1 + 1?
1. 2
2. 4
3. 8
4. 42

Especially note that the number before the question is the number that the question is stored under in the chapter file, not the number of the question in the quiz. This is done so that it is easier to find the question in case it needs to be modified.

After you complete a question, if you still have more questions left to go in the quiz then you will be asked to answer another random question from the chapter that you haven't answered yet durring the current quiz. This process will be repeated until you have answered as many questions as you specified that you wanted to answer when you ran the program.

Once you have answered all the questions in the quiz you will be given the results of the quiz. You will be shown the number of questions answered in the quiz, the number of questions answered correctly, the number of questions answered incorrectly, and the percentage score of the quiz.
