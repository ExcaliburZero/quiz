001 - Creating a Chapter

Before you are able to make questions for quizzes you must generate the chapter files which will store the questions. All questions are sorted by chapters, with each chapter having a numerical value (1, 2, 3, etc.) in order to mirror the chapters of a text book. When a quiz is generated it will pull random questions from a specified chapter.

To create a chapter file you must run "Chapter Generator.py". You will then be asked for the number of the chapter (1, 2, 3, etc.). Once you input the chapter number the program will generate the chapter file. Note that chapter files are all stored in the "Questions" folder, as for example "Chapter 1.txt". Once the chapter file is generated you can then move on to creating the questions.
=====================
002 - Creating Questions

After you have created a chapter file you can now create question for that chapter. Be sure that you generate the chapter file before attempting to add questions to it otherwise it may not work correctly.

To add questions to a chapter you must run "Question Generator.py". You will first be asked for your name. Your name will be stored with each question that you make in order to identify you as the one who made the question. You will then be asked which chapter you want to make questions for, be sure to enter the correct number of the chapter (1, 2, 3, etc.).

You will then be asked for the question. Be sure to end the question with a question mark and not a period. You will then be asked for the multiple choice answers for the question, note that you are asked them one at a time. You do not need to add a prefix to the answers like "a)" or "b." as the program will automatically add those in.
