001 - Creating a Chapter

Before you are able to make questions for quizzes you must generate the chapter files which will store the questions. All questions are sorted by chapters, with each chapter having a numerical value (1, 2, 3, etc.) in order to mirror the chapters of a text book. When a quiz is generated it will pull random questions from a specified chapter.

To create a chapter file you must run "Chapter Generator.py". You will then be asked for the number of the chapter (1, 2, 3, etc.). Once you input the chapter number the program will generate the chapter file. Note that chapter files are all stored in the "Questions" folder, as for example "Chapter 1.txt". Once the chapter file is generated you can then move on to creating the questions.

002 - Creating Questions

After you have created a chapter file you can now create question for that chapter. Be sure that you generate the chapter file before attempting to add questions to it otherwise it may not work correctly.

To add questions to a chapter you must run "Question Generator.py". You will first be asked for your name. Your name will be stored with each question that you make in order to identify you as the one who made the question. You will then be asked which chapter you want to make questions for, be sure to enter the correct number of the chapter (1, 2, 3, etc.).

You will then be asked for the question. Be sure to end the question with a question mark and not a period. You will then be asked for the four multiple choice answers for the question, note that you are asked them one at a time. You do not need to add a prefix to the answers like "a)" or "b." as the program will automatically add those in. After you enter all four multiple answers you must then enter the number of the correct answer (1, 2, 3, or 4).

The program will then output the question in the format it will be displayed durring the quiz with the correct answer as well. At this point you should check it for spelling, grammar, or other mistakes. You will then be asked if the question is correct, and if it is correct then input a lower case "y". If the question is not correct then input "n", and you will then be asked to re-input the question info.

Once you have correctly entered the question you will be asked if you would like to make another question for that same chapter. If you would like to enter another question for the same chapter then input "y", and you will then be able to input another question. You can enter as many questions in a row as you want, but they will only be saved after you select that you do not want to enter any more questions to the selected chapter. When you are done entering questions for the selected chapter input "n", and then the question(s) you have entered will be saved to the selected chapter file.

In order to add more questions to a chapter different than the chapter specified when the program was run you must finish running the program, and then re-run the program but specifiy the new chapter that you want to add questions to.
=====================
003 - Creating a Quiz

Once you have added some questions to a chapter you can now generate quizzes for that chapter. Currently quizzes can only be done by using a computer to input your answers, there is currently no function to output quizzes into a print-able format.

To do a randomly generated quiz on a topic you must run "Quiz Generator.py".
